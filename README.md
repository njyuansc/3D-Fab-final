Project 3: Self-Driven Research Project
This project is to be completed individually.

The remainder of the semester is for you to realize one small, personally driven research project. This can include anything related to, or incorporating, 3D printing or laser cutting (or both).

You've all learned a lot of new tools and skills in this class. I want to see you pushing the limits of your abilities!

Chat (or email) with me about your project plan for the remaining two weeks (Dec. 1st)
Work presentations will be on the last day of class (Dec. 15th)
Documentation and source code pushed to GitHub no later than Dec. 19th.
Schedule:

Dec. 1st: Work session. Discuss your project plan with me BEFORE THIS DATE.
Dec. 8th: Work session.
Dec. 15th: Project presentations.
Dec. 19th: Documentation due.
